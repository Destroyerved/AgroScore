AgroScore is an innovative project aimed at revolutionizing the credit evaluation process for farmers in India by utilizing non-traditional data sources. The goal is to create an inclusive credit scoring system that addresses the unique challenges faced by farmers in accessing credit.

Problem Statement:
The current agricultural credit evaluation methods often fail to capture the complexities and specificities of farming operations. Farmers, especially smallholders, encounter numerous barriers when seeking credit, including:
  --> Lack of formal financial history.
  --> Complex application processes.
  --> Limited access to traditional banking services.

AgroScore aims to bridge this gap by leveraging alternative data sources such as GIS data, weather patterns, soil health metrics, and historical crop yields to create a more accurate and fair credit evaluation system.

Current Status
As of now, we have developed prototypes for both the main website and the console website. These prototypes serve as the foundation for our future work on the AgroScore platform.
Prototype
Main Website: AgroScore Main Website
Console Website: AgroScore Console Website

Chatbot and Model
We are also working on a chatbot and model to enhance user interaction and provide automated assistance. You can access our current chatbot model at the following link:
